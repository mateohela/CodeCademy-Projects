# CodeCademy-Projects
Most of the project data and ideas were given by CodeCademy. All the projects have been completed with some slight different coding. 

The final project https://github.com/mateohela/CodeCademy-Projects/blob/main/Business%20Intelligence%20Data%20Analyst/Final%20Project/Supermarket%20Sales/Supermarket%20Sales%20Analysis-Final.ipynb 
was completed without any help, where I put a lot of the concepts that I learned to practise. This course took a while to be completed but it is very much worth it. You gain a lot of knowledge on different domains. From asking the right questions and understanding what the clients want to achieve, to creating an amazing Analytics paper.
