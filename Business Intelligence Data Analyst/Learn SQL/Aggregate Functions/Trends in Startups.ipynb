    "It was a small interesting database. I would like to play with a similar one but with more data. Some hypothesis that can be tested are: Is the stage linked with the valuation, employes, founded or raised. Does more valuation mean more employees? Are they related? and how (example: linearly?). Do older companies have bigger valuation? or it depends more on their category? If I wanted to extend the analysis I would try to find their current valuation and make a percentage valuation on how much they have grown or shrunk. Then we can restart our analysis with more options, such as did the technological companies have a greater increase?\n"
